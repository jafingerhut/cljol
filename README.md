# Introduction

`cljol` is specific to Clojure on Java.  It uses a JVM library that
knows deep internal details of the JVM, and those parts would need to
be replaced with something else in order to work on a non-JVM
platform.

`cljol` uses the [Java Object
Layout](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jol) library to
determine the precise size of a Java object, and all of the objects
that it references, either directly, or by following a chain of
references through multiple Java objects.

It can create images of these graphs, either:

+ popping up a window using the `view` function.
+ writing to a GraphViz dot file using the `write-dot-file` function.
+ writing to any of several other image file formats using the
  `write-drawing-file` function.

`cljol` has been tested most with Clojure 1.10.1 so far, but as far as
I know should work fine with Clojure 1.7.0 or later (it cannot go
earlier, since the Loom graph library requires that version of Clojure
or later).

See the [gallery](doc/README-gallery.md) for examples of figures
created by this library that demonstrate aspects of the Java VM or
Clojure's implementation that I find interesting.


# Quick example

You must install [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org) in order for the
generation of figures to work -- see its home page for downloads and
installation instructions if the following do not work:

* Ubuntu Linux - `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
* Mac OS X
  * If you use Homebrew: `brew install graphviz`
  * If you use MacPorts: `sudo port install graphviz`

There are not yet any packaged releases of `cljol` on Clojars.  You
can clone the repository yourself and create a JAR if you like, or use
the `clj` / `clojure` commands provided by the Clojure installer.

No extra JVM options are necessary if you are running JDK 8 or 11:

```bash
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {cljol/cljol {:git/url "https://github.com/jafingerhut/cljol" :sha "dc17a8e02f5abf7aacf6c1962c627fe7b19993d0"}}}'
```

If you are running JDK 16 or later, then the additional JVM command
line options below are strongly recommended.  Not using these options
often leads to missing edges between objects in drawn graphs, and/or
fields with the values omitted, showing the message `.setAccessible
failed` in place of the field value.

```bash
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {cljol/cljol {:git/url "https://github.com/jafingerhut/cljol" :sha "dc17a8e02f5abf7aacf6c1962c627fe7b19993d0"}}}' \
    -J-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf \
    -J-Djol.tryWithSudo=true \
    -J-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading \
    -J--add-opens -Jjava.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED \
    -J--add-opens -Jjava.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED \
    -J--add-opens -Jjava.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED \
    -J--add-opens -Jjava.base/java.util.concurrent.locks=ALL-UNNAMED
```

In the REPL:
```
(require '[cljol.dig9 :as d])
(def my-map {"a" 1 "foobar" 3.5})

;; Open a new window containing the figure.  Takes a collection of
;; objects.
(d/view [my-map])

;; Write the figure to a Graphviz dot file, or one of many other
;; formats.  I believe you can get a complete list of formats
;; supported by Graphviz by looking at the "device" list in the output
;; of the command "dot -v < /dev/null".

(d/write-dot-file [my-map] "my-map.dot")
(d/write-drawing-file [my-map] "my-map.pdf" :pdf)
```

See the "Warning messages" section below for messages that you are
likely to see when using this code.

Graphviz dot files are a fairly simple text file format you can read
in any text editor, and convert to many other graphic formats.  You
need not use the commands below to create these other formats, as the
example of creating a PDF format file above shows, but below are some
sample commands you can run in a shell to do this conversion:

```bash
$ dot -Tpdf my-map.dot -o my-map.pdf
$ dot -Tpng my-map.dot -o my-map.png
```

Below is the figure in the file `my-map.png` I get from the last
command above.

Each rectangle is a Java object.  The object (or objects) that you
specified to start from are filled with a gray shading.  By default
each rectangle shows:

* the object's size
* the number of objects reachable from that object, via following a
  path of references starting from that object, which includes that
  object itself.  Also the total size in bytes of all of those
  reachable objects.
* either the message "this object in no reference cycles" or
  "`<number>` objects in same SCC with this one".  The first message
  means that in the graph of objects reached from the ones you
  specified to start from, that object is not contained in any cycle
  of references.  The second message means that the object does appear
  in at least one cycle of references, and there are `<number>`
  objects such that they are all in the same SCC, or "strongly
  connected component", of the graph of references.  Two nodes "a" and
  "b" are in the same SCC exactly when there is a path from "a" to
  "b", and also a path from "b" to "a".
* its type, usually a class name, with common prefixes like
  "clojure.lang." replaced with "c.l." and "java.lang." replaced with
  "j.l.".  Java arrays are shown as "array of N `class-name`".
* A sequence of lines, one per field stored in the object.  This is
  all per-instance fields (i.e. not declared static in Java) defined
  for the object's class, and all of its superclasses.  Each is listed
  with:
  * its byte offset from the beginning of the object in memory where
    the field is stored
  * the name of the field
  * its type, in parentheses
  * the value of the field
* All references to other objects only show "ref" as the type.  The
  value of a "ref" field is shown as "nil" if it is a Clojure nil
  value (i.e. Java null), or `->` if the reference is to another
  object -- you may find the actual class of the referenced object by
  following the edge labeled with the field name that leaves the node.
* a string representation of the object's value, or the message "val
  maybe realizes if str'ed".  If you see that message, it means that
  `cljol` has determined that if it tried to convert the value to a
  string, it might cause lazy sequences to be realized more than they
  already have been before, and it is avoiding this possibility.

The string representation is by default limited to 50 characters, with
" ..." appearing at the end if it was truncated.

The arrows out of an array object are labeled with "[i]", where "i" is
a number that is the array index.  Other labels on edges are the name
of the field in the Java object that the edge comes from.

Immediately below is the `cljol` drawing of the objects representing
the Clojure map `{"a" 1 "foobar" 3.5}`.  In a
`clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap`, map keys are in even array indices,
and their associated values in the index 1 larger.

# More examples

It does not take much code to create data structures with very large
graphs.  For example, this graph likely has more nodes than you want
to look at:

```
(def v1 (vec (range 1000)))
(d/view [v1])
```

`cljol` includes some code to give you summary statistics about a
graph, and some functions that can produce a subset of a graph, which
you can then display.

The `sum` function takes a collection of objects, creates and returns
a graph representing its objects without drawing it, and prints some
statistics about this graph.  The example below shows that v1's graph
has 1067 objects.  The info near the end shows that 1001 of those have
out-degree 0, where out-degree is the number of edges that leave a
node directed towards another node.  Those 1001 are 'leaf nodes' of
the graph.

```
user=> (def g (d/sum [v1]))

#'user/g
```

Here is a way to create another graph `g2` from `g` with all of `g`'s
leaves removed, and then draw `g2`:

```
(require '[ubergraph.core :as uber]
         '[cljol.graph :as gr]
         '[cljol.ubergraph-extras :as gre])

(def g2 (uber/remove-nodes* g (gr/leaf-nodes g)))

(d/view-graph g2)
```

Below we demonstrate keeping only those nodes that are within at most
distance 3 of the starting objects given when creating the graph.
That is, the Java object is reachable from one of the starting objects
in 3 or fewer 'hops'.

```
(def g3 (gre/induced-subgraph g (filter #(<= (uber/attr g % :distance) 3)
                                         (uber/nodes g))))

(d/view-graph g3)
```

These graphs `g`, `g2`, and `g3` are all created using the
[Ubergraph](https://github.com/Engelberg/ubergraph) library.  All of
its features are available for manipulating these graphs.  The drawing
functions use keys in the node and edge attribute maps to affect some
aspects of the drawings, e.g. the `:label` key is used to generate the
labels.

Another thing that can be interesting to see is the fraction of
objects shared between a persistent collection, and the persistent
collection created by making a small change to the first collection.

```
(def v1 (vec (range 5)))
(def v2 (conj v1 5))
(def g (d/sum [v1 v2]))

;; Create a graph from g, different because of some additional
;; attributes added to the nodes by the function
;; add-attributes-by-reachability

;; Any node reachable ":only-from" object v1 will have its attributes
;; augmented by adding the `:color "red"`.  Any node reachable only
;; from object v2 will have color green.  Any node reachable from more
;; than one root node will be blue, and any reachable from no root
;; will be colored gray.

(def g2 (d/add-attributes-by-reachability g
         [{:only-from v1
           :attrs {:color "red"}}
          {:only-from v2
           :attrs {:color "green"}}
          {:from-multiple true
           :attrs {:color "blue"}}
          {:from-none true
           :attrs {:color "gray"}}]))

(d/view-graph g2)
(d/view-graph g2 {:save {:filename "g2.pdf" :format :pdf}})
```


# Warning messages

When running with JDK 16 or later and the extra command line options
recommended above, I typically see a warning like the one below the
first time I call the function `view`, `write-dot-file`, or
`write-drawing-file`:

```bash
# WARNING: Unable to attach Serviceability Agent. sun.jvm.hotspot.memory.Universe.getNarrowOopBase()
```

The presence of this warning does not seem to harm the functionality
of `cljol` in any way.

Tested with:

* Ubuntu 24.04, Adoptium OpenJDK 8, 11, 16-24, Clojure 1.12.0
* Ubuntu 18.04.2, OpenJDK 11, Clojure 1.10.1
* Ubuntu 18.04.2, Oracle JDK 8, Clojure 1.10.1
* Mac OS X 10.13 High Sierra, Oracle JDK 8, Clojure 1.10.1

It should work with older versions of Clojure, too, but I do not know
how far back it can go.  Probably as far back as Clojure 1.7, which is
required by the version of the Loom library that cljol depends upon.


# Possible future work

Perhaps some day this library might be enhanced to create nice figures
and/or summary statistics showing how many of these objects are shared
between two Clojure collections.  There is some code in the
`cljol.dig` namespace written with that in mind, but it is at best not
well tested and thus probably contains many errors, if it even runs at
all.

It would be nice if there was a way to cause the edges out of Java
array objects to at least usually be in increasing order of array
index.  Right now they are fairly arbitrary.
