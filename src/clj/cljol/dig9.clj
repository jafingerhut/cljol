;; Note 1:

;; I have seen issues before with objects 'obj' such that (=
;; java.lang.Class (class obj)) is true, e.g. for obj=(class
;; 5)=java.lang.Long, where the size in bytes determined by (. gpr
;; size) was significantly larger, e.g. 632 bytes, than the size
;; reported using ClassLayout/parseClass followed by the instanceSize
;; method, e.g. 96 bytes.

;; This can cause later sanity checks of objects that overlap in
;; memory to fail (see function any-objects-overlap?), when they
;; should succeed.

;; From some more testing on macOS and Ubuntu Linux, and JDK versions
;; ranging over 8, 9, 11, and 12, I have only seen this issue with JDK
;; 8, on all operating systems, but so far never with JDK 9, 11, nor
;; 12 (only tested on Linux so far).  So far I have never seen it
;; happen for any objects 'obj' where (class obj) is anything _except_
;; java.lang.Class.

;; I do not know if this is a bug in JOL 0.9, or the JDK, but since it
;; seems to be corrected in later JDK versions, I will not worry too
;; much about it now, other than to try to avoid the problem here.

;; From some testing with a graph of objects containing over 100,000
;; nodes, I did not notice it taking much longer using the 'slow' way,
;; so it is probably a good idea to simply consistently use that way
;; all of the time.

;; Using ClassLayout/parseInstance returns accurate sizes for array
;; objects, whereas ClassLayout/parseClass only returns the size of a
;; 0 length array of the same type, because it has no information
;; about the particular array object to get the number of array
;; elements from.

;; existing data structure with new ones created from them via
;; operations like conj, assoc, disj, etc.

;; When should two objects be considered the same in two object
;; graphs?

;; If no compaction/moving of objects has occurred in memory between
;; traversing the object graph of objects X and Y, then an object in
;; X's object graph and in Y's object graph are the same if their
;; addresses are the same.  They should also point at identical
;; objects, and have equal :size and :fields values.

;; If compaction/moving of objects _has_ occurred, then objects in X
;; and Y's object graphs could overlap, perhaps at the same address,
;; and yet be different objects.  It would be good to do some sanity
;; checking to try to determine if this happens, to avoid erroneous or
;; misleading results.

;; Effectively the values in the :address fields are a snapshot of
;; what an object's address was at the time the data structure was
;; created, and the object could move afterwards.

;; Sanity checks: For each object, see if its current address is the
;; same or different as that recorded in the :address field.  Even
;; doing such a sanity check can return 'nothing has moved' at the
;; time it is checked, but the next garbage collection can change the
;; answer.  Having a way to notify the user on every garbage
;; collection event may be useful to detect when object moves can
;; occur.

;; I have unit-tested any-object-moved? with some simple objects
;; like (def pv1 [1 2 3 4 5]) and (def pv2 (conj pv1 6)), and seen
;; that most often if I do that followed
;; by (any-object-moved? (reachable-objmaps pv1)) or on pv2, nothing has
;; moved.  If I do (System/gc) and then repeat those calls, typically
;; something will have moved.

;; Terminology:

;; A 'javaobj' is one of the Java objects found while calling
;; reachable-objmaps on the object given to reachable-objmaps as a
;; parameter.

;; An 'objmap' is a Clojure map describing exactly one of those
;; javaobjs.  An objmap contains at least the keys returned by
;; reachable-objmaps, but perhaps also more.

;; The value returned by reachable-objmaps is a sequence of objmaps.

;; The function object-graph->ubergraph creates a graph, as
;; implemented by the ubergraph library, and that can be used to draw
;; a figure of the graph using Graphviz, where each node represents a
;; javaobj, and there is an edge from node A to B if javaobj A has a
;; reference to javaobj B.

;; In this graph, I want each javaobj in memory to be represented by
;; exactly one node.  If a javaobj X is referenced from multiple other
;; javaobjs, and they are in the graph, too, then there should be
;; multiple edges into the node for X.

;; Also, in Clojure two values can be equal according to
;; clojure.core/=, but they might be the identical javaobj, or they
;; might be different javaobjs in memory.  The graph drawn here should
;; show separate nodes if they are separate javaobjs in memory.

;; ubergraph lets the caller pick the values used to represent nodes.
;; Because I want different javaobjs in memory to be different nodes
;; in the graph, one way to do that is to use the numeric address of
;; the object in memory to represent a graph node for ubergraph.  If
;; we tried using the javaobj itself to represent a node to ubergraph,
;; I suspect that it would treat any two of them that were
;; clojure.core/= to each other as the same node, even if they were
;; different javaobjs in memory.

;; Null references stored in one javaobj will not be represented in
;; the graph created.  They will show up with the name of the fields
;; and the value "nil" if you use the field-values function to label
;; the nodes in any drawn graphs.

;; One reason I chose ubergraph over the rhizome library is that
;; ubergraph supports multiple parallel directed edges from a node A
;; to another node B in the graph at the same time, where each edge
;; has different attributes, and different labels when drawn using
;; Graphviz.  This is important for representing a javaobj A with
;; multiple references to the same javaobj B, but in different fields
;; of A.

;; This code uses the library: ubergraph 0.5.3
;; which in turn uses the library: dorothy 0.0.6

;; That version of dorothy when given node and edge attributes with
;; the key :label and a value that is a string, will do these
;; replacements in function dorothy.core/escape-quotes:

;;   "  replaced with   \"

;; That version of ubergraph, before passing label strings to dorothy,
;; will do these replacements in function
;; ubergraph.core/escape-backslashes, but only if you request that it
;; create node and edge labels for you with the :auto-label true
;; option.  Without that option, this replacement is not performed on
;; labels you provide to ubergraph.

;;   \  replaced with   \\

;; rhizome 0.2.9 makes these replacements in label strings, in
;; function rhizome.dot/escape-string:

;; Replace any of these single characters:
;;   \  |  {  }  "
;; with that character prepended with a backslash character.


;; What does dot support in label strings?  I am not 100% sure, but
;; rhizome has been working pretty well so far with what I have thrown
;; at it.

;; One way to use ubergraph 0.5.3 and dorothy 0.0.6 without changing
;; them, and get the rhizome set of characters escaped exactly once
;; each, is, before calling ubergraph to add the labels, to replace
;; the strings that rhizome does, _except for_ ".  Then let dorothy
;; replace the ".

;; Dorothy has a bug - it only escapes double quote characters in
;; labels, but not any of the characters below, so we do it here

;; "java.version" "11.0.3",
;; "java.runtime.version" "11.0.3+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu218.04.1",

;; All strings had a 24-byte java.lang.String object, which pointed at
;; another Java object which was an array of primitive bytes.
;; The length of the array of bytes always equaled the length of the string.
;; The size of the array object varied as follows:

;; B=byte array length  A=array object size
;; -------------------  -------------------
;;  0                   16
;;  1- 8                24
;;  9-16                32
;; 17-24                40
;; 25-32                48
;; 33-40                56

;; 42-48                64
;; 50-56                72
;; 58-64                80
;; 66-72                88

;; All of the above are consistent with the formula:
;; A = 16 + 8*ceiling(B/8)

;; Every String with this version of the JVM takes either L bytes to
;; store its characters, if those characters all fit within 8 bits, or
;; 2*L bytes if they do not.

;; The array object is 16 bytes on top of that, and the String object
;; is 24 bytes on top of that.
